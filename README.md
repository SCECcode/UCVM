# UCVMC
The '''Unified Community Velocity Model C-language (UCVMC)''' software framework is a collection of software tools designed to provide standard interface to multiple, alternative, California 3D velocity models. UCVMC is used in high resolution 3D wave propagation simulations for California. UCVMC development is an interdisciplinary research collaboration involving geoscientists and computer scientists.

The Unified Community Velocity Model C-language (UCVMC) software repository contains a software codebase developed by Patrick Small, David Gill, and Philip Maechling at SCEC between 2012-2017. UCVMC is released as open-source scientific software under and Apache 2 software license.

The UCVMC source code repository contains the reference implementation of the original UCVM software framework. The UCVMC distribution is based on the UCVM V15.10 release. The UCVM v15.10 software distribution includes several software features that provide great user flexibility, but make the UCVM v15.10 software difficult to install, use, and support.

This UCVMC distribution is a simplied version of the C-language UCVM v15.10 software platform. This distribution preserves a reference implementation for each key UCVM feature and examples that illustrate their usage and results.
