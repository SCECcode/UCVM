UCVMC - Unified Community Velocity Model C-Language Software Framework
Date: 12 Dec 2016
http://scec.usc.edu/scecpedia/UCVMC

1.0 Software System Requirements
================

The basic system requirements are as follows: 

Required software packages for basic installation:
- Current Linux operating system, network connection, 16GB Ram, 50GB diskspace
- git client
- GNU gcc/gfortran compilers
- Python 2.7 with multiple extension libraries including (matplotlib,numpy)
- automake tools (autoconf, automake, configure, make)
- Euclid Etree library: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~euclid/
- Proj.4 projection library: http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/
- Fast Fourier Wave Transform library: 

Provided Community Velocity Models: 
 - SCEC CVM-H v15.1.0 
 - SCEC CVM-S4 
 - SCEC CVM-S4.26
 - SCEC CVM-S4.26.M01
 - USGS Bayarea Models

Optional dependencies include any of the following standard velocity models
and packages:
- MPI Libraries - Used in parallel mesh extraction
- NetCDF Libraries - Used to output meshes in netcdf format

2.0 Installation
================
The basic install of UCVM on a properly configured Linux system. 

UCVM requires two Directory Trees:
UCVM src tree. Create a directory where to collect files and build the distribution. 
UCVM bin tree. This is a directory where ucvm will be installed. 

$mkdir /home/scec-00/maechlin/ucvm_src
$cd /home/scec-00/maechlin/ucvm_src
$git clone https://github.com/SCECcode/UCVMC.git
$cd UCVMC
$./ucvm_setup.py

Then simply answer all the questions in the script. It will ask you which models
you would like to install (CVM-S4, CVM-S4.26, CVM-S4.26.M01, CVM-H, and BayArea).

The script will then automatically download and install the models you selected.

3.0 Configuration
=================

The main application configuration file is ${UCVM_INSTALL_DIR}/conf/ucvm.conf. 
This is where the paths to all configured models and maps are specified, as 
well as any model flags are defined. The UCVM installer sets up this file 
automatically. Yet there are a number of situations where you will want to 
modify it, such as to add a new model.

Please see the User Guide for more details on how to edit the UCVM config.


5.1 Standard Models

The standard models are referenced with the following labels:

cvmh	     	    SCEC CVM-H 15.1.0
cvms4	     	    SCEC CVM-S4
cencal	     	  USGS Bay Area CenCalVM
cvms4.26	      SCEC CVM-S4.26
cvms4.26.M01    SCEC CVM-S4.26.M01
1d		    		  Hadley-Kanamori 1D in 9 layers

Note that the model must be linked in at install time if it is to be queried 
through UCVM.

5.2 Standard Maps

ucvm	     USGS NED DEM and Wills-Wald Vs30 (default)
