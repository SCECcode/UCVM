Overview of current installation process:

The Git repository does not contain largefiles needed by the UCVM system.
The .gitignore excludes most files in the largefiles directory

Currently, we stage the largefiles externally, giving the user options on how they
assemble the list of needed files.

The script are designed to be run in the UCVMC/largefiles dirctory

First, the user runs a script to get the largefiles.
This script copies the files from USC into the local directory.
./get_large_files.py

Second, the user runs a script to confirm the largefiles are intact.
This script prints out the number of OK files and the number of files with errors.
If any files have errors, those files should be re-downloaded.
./check_largefiles_md5.py

Third, the user runs the stage_files script:
This copies the files from the largefiles directory into the ucvm directory tree
%./stage_large_files.py


Finally, the user moves out of the UCVMC/largefiles directory, into the UCVM home directory.
From the UCVM/ home directory, the user runs:
%./ucvm_setup.py

This will run the configure, make, install commands to build the libraries and models.
