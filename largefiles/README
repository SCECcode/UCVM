Overview of current installation process:

The Git repository does not contain largefiles needed by the UCVM system.
The .gitignore excludes most files in the largefiles directory

Currently, we stage the largefiles externally, giving the user options on how they
assemble the list of needed files.

First, the user runs 
%./get_large_files.py

This copies the files from USC inot the local directory.

Second, the user runs:
%./stage_large_files.py

This copies the files from the largefiles directory into the ucvm directory tree

Third, the user moves out of the UCVMC/largefiles directory, and runs:
%./ucvm_setup.py

This will run the configure,make, install commands to build the libraries and models.
