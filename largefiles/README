Overview of current installation process:

The Git repository does not contain largefiles needed by the UCVM system.
The .gitignore excludes most files in the largefiles directory

Currently, we stage the largefiles externally, giving the user options on how they
assemble the list of needed files.

Then, before we move the largefiles directory into the ucvm source tree, and
run ./ucvm_setup.py, user will run the
./stage_ucvm_large_files.py path_to_source_files.
