Overview of current installation process:

The Git repository does not contain largefiles needed by the UCVM system.
The .gitignore excludes most files in the largefiles directory

Currently, we stage the largefiles externally, giving the user options on how they
assemble the list of needed files.

First, the user edits, then runs:
This script copies the files from USC into the local directory.
%./get_large_files.py

Second, the user edits, then runs the stage_files script:
User should edits paths in this file, to point to the the "largefiles" and to the UCVMC source directory
This copies the files from the largefiles directory into the ucvm directory tree
%./stage_large_files.py


Third, the user moves out of the UCVMC/largefiles directory, and runs:
%./ucvm_setup.py

This will run the configure, make, install commands to build the libraries and models.
