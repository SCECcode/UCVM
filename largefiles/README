Overview of current installation process:

The Git repository does not contain largefiles needed by the UCVM system.
The .gitignore excludes most files in the largefiles directory

Currently, we stage the largefiles externally, giving the user options on how they
assemble the list of needed files.

The script are designed to be run in the UCVM/largefiles dirctory

First, the user runs a script to get the largefiles.
This script asks user which model should be downloaded then the selected model 
files and other large files are copied from an external repository into the local 
directory.
./get_largefiles.py

Second, the user runs a script to confirm the largefiles are intact.
This script prints out the number of OK files and the number of files with errors.
If any files have errors, those files should be re-downloaded.
./check_largefiles_md5.py

Third, the user runs the file staging script:
This links the files from the largefiles directory into the ucvm build directory tree
./stage_largefiles.py


Finally, the user moves out of the UCVM/largefiles directory, into the UCVM home directory.
From the UCVM home directory, the user runs:
./ucvm_setup.py

This will run the configure, make, install commands to build the libraries and models.
