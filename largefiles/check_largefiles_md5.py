# Script for checking downloaded UCVM Files. This script should be run
# after the UCVM largefiles have been retrieved from their respository
# into the UCVMC/largefiles subdirectory.
#
# When both the UCVMC/largefiles and their associated md5 files
# are located in the same directory, then this script will confirm
# that the largefiles are intact.
#
# The md5 files are downloaded from git repository
# Then largefiles are downloaded from SCEC website
# This script confirms that all files have been downloaded intact.
# This script provides assurance that the downloaded largefiles
# are the files required for UCVMC to work properly
